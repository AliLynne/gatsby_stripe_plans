# Github Organization Manager

The Github Organization Manager takes the pain out of managing organizations with many repositories by adding a few missing features-

* Global repository settings so changes don't have to be manually applied to every repository.
* Automatic assignment of new issues to projects.
* A global list of labels (name, color, and description) to use for every repository.
